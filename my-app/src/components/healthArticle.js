        <h3>How Do Smartphones Affect Our Sleep?</h3>
        <p>
        Abstract: Do you own a smartphone? They are very useful and often we canâ€™t imagine life without them. But they could be harmful as well. For example, people can get addicted to smartphones. As with any other addiction, this can lead to various problems. So does it affect our sleep? To find out, we asked 1,043 students to complete two questionnaires. This helped us determine how many of the students suffer from smartphone addiction. It also showed how many suffer from poor sleep. We found out that smartphone addiction is pretty common among young students. We also found a strong connection between smartphone addiction and poor sleep.

To cope, it might help to speak with a doctor privately in person; to communicate with the doctor on the phone or via a patient portal; to see a specialist; to write down questions and hand them to the doctor; or to describe a problem in a professional, matter-of-fact way, using medical terms (such as "stool" or "bowel movement" instead of "poop").
